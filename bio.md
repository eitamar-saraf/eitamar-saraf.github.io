# About Me

## Personal Background

My name is **Eitamar Saraf**, and I'm a passionate data scientist and researcher with a deep interest in artificial intelligence and machine learning. I believe in the power of technology to solve real-world problems and am constantly exploring new frontiers in computer vision, natural language processing, and deep learning.

## Academic Journey

I hold a **B.Sc. in Computer Science and Mathematics** from Ariel University, where I developed a strong foundation in both theoretical and applied computer science. My academic journey continued at Bar Ilan University, where I completed my **M.Sc. in Computer Science** under the supervision of two distinguished professors:

- **Prof. Noam Shomron** - A leading researcher in computational biology and genomics
- **Prof. Yoram Louzoun** - An expert in mathematical modeling and computational biology

My thesis focused on **deep learning-based DNA separation**, a project that combined my passion for machine learning with cutting-edge genomic research. This work involved developing novel neural network architectures to solve complex biological problems, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in computational biology.

## Professional Experience

With **four years of experience** in the field, I've had the opportunity to work on diverse and challenging projects:

- **Machine Learning & Deep Learning Models**: Developed state-of-the-art models for computer vision and NLP applications
- **Full-Stack Development**: Built comprehensive web applications that integrate ML models with user-friendly interfaces
- **Project Leadership**: Led projects from initial concept through to successful completion, managing teams and timelines
- **Research & Development**: Conducted experiments, published findings, and contributed to the scientific community

## Research Interests

My current research interests include:

- **Computer Vision**: Image classification, object detection, and image generation
- **Natural Language Processing**: Text analysis, language modeling, and semantic understanding
- **Deep Learning**: Neural network architectures, optimization techniques, and interpretability
- **Computational Biology**: Genomic data analysis, DNA sequence processing, and biological modeling
- **Generative AI**: GANs, VAEs, and other generative models for creative applications

## Personal Life

Beyond my professional work, I'm a person of diverse interests:

- **Amateur Farmer**: I enjoy growing my own food and understanding the natural world
- **Avid Reader**: Constantly learning and exploring new ideas through literature
- **Computer Tinkerer**: I love building, repairing, and optimizing computer systems
- **Problem Solver**: I enjoy tackling complex challenges and finding innovative solutions

## Philosophy
