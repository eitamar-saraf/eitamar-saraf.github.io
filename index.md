## About Me

I'm a passionate data scientist with four years of experience in computer vision, NLP, and full-stack engineering. I hold a B.Sc. in computer science and mathematics from Ariel University and an M.Sc. in computer science from Bar Ilan University, where I completed my thesis on **deep learning-based DNA separation** under the supervision of [Prof. Noam Shomron](https://nshomron.github.io/) and [Prof. Yoram Louzoun](https://yolo.math.biu.ac.il/).

In my professional experience, I have developed ML and DL models for applications in computer vision and NLP, built full-stack web applications, and led projects from concept to completion. Outside work, I'm an amateur farmer, an avid reader, and an occasional tinkerer who enjoys repairing and building computers.
