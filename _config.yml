  With over three years of experience in computer vision and natural language processing, 
  I like good software engineering and DevOps as side projects. 
  I completed my B.Sc. in computer science and mathematics at Ariel University and my M.Sc. 
  in computer science at Bar Ilan University under <a href="https://nshomron.github.io/">Prof. Noam Shomron</a> 
  and <a href="https://yolo.math.biu.ac.il/">Prof. Yoram Louzoun</a>.
  In addition to my professional life, I'm an amateur farmer and a voracious reader, 
  and I've been repairing and building computers since I was 13.
